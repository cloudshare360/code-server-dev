Great! Given that your local folder path on macOS is `/Users/sri/Documents/Sri/working/code-server-docker-compose`, you can update the `docker-compose.yml` file like this:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  code-server:
    image: codercom/code-server:latest
    container_name: code-server
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:8080" # Map port 8080
    volumes:
      - /Users/sri/Documents/Sri/working/code-server-docker-compose:/home/coder/project # Mount local folder
    environment:
      - PASSWORD=yourpassword # Set a password for code-server
```

### Steps to apply this:
1. Ensure your local folder (`/Users/sri/Documents/Sri/working/code-server-docker-compose`) exists.
2. Save this configuration inside a `docker-compose.yml` file.
3. Run:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
4. Access your code-server via `http://localhost:8080`.

This will ensure your local folder is mapped properly inside the container! Let me know if you run into any issues. ðŸš€

Hmm, let's troubleshoot this! Here are a few things to check:

1. **Confirm the environment variable is correctly set**  
   Run:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec code-server env | grep PASSWORD
   ```  
   If you donâ€™t see the `PASSWORD=yourpassword` variable, the environment configuration might not have applied correctly.

2. **Try setting the password manually**  
   If the password isn't working, you can explicitly pass it when starting the container:  
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - PASSWORD=yourpassword
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Check the logs**  
   Run:  
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f code-server
   ```  
   Look for any error messages regarding authentication.

4. **Try launching without a password**  
   If all else fails, you can disable password authentication (and use a separate authentication method instead):  
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - AUTH=none
   ```
   Restart the container and see if you can access it.

Let me know if you spot any errors or if something still isnâ€™t working! ðŸš€
